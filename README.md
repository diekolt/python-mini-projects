# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

This repository documents my Python learning journey through progressively harder mini-projects — from the basics all the way to advanced and expert-level applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **beginner/** → Fundamentals (loops, conditionals, basic functions)
- **beginner-intermediate/** → Simple games and logic-based projects
- **intermediate/** → File handling, GUIs, APIs
- **advanced/** → Automation, bots, and networking
- **expert/** → AI, machine learning, and complete applications
- **checklist/** → Progress trackers (PDF + Excel)

## 🛠 Progress Tracking
I am working through projects step by step.  
Check my progress in the `checklist/` folder:

- [x] Create repository and structure  
- [x] Upload checklists  
- [ ] Complete first beginner project  
- [ ] Move through beginner → expert levels  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen Python fundamentals through practice  
- Build a portfolio of projects visible to recruiters  
- Progress into AI/automation-focused development  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add more beginner projects  
- Expand into intermediate tasks (file I/O, GUIs)  
- Eventually move into advanced projects (bots, APIs, AI)
